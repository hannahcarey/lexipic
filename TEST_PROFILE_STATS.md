# 📊 Profile Statistics Implementation

## ✅ What We've Implemented

### Backend Improvements

1. **Enhanced User Statistics Calculation** (`/backend/api/src/utils/supabase.ts`)
   - ✅ **Total Score**: Combines correct answers + accuracy bonus
   - ✅ **Questions Answered**: Total flashcards seen by user
   - ✅ **Day Streak**: Consecutive days of activity (not just correct answers)
   - ✅ **Improved XP System**: Base XP + accuracy bonuses
   - ✅ **Level Calculation**: 250 XP per level (matches frontend expectation)

2. **Real Day Streak Logic**
   - Tracks consecutive calendar days with activity
   - Maintains streak if user was active today OR yesterday
   - Breaks streak if no activity for 2+ days
   - Uses activity dates from `user_flashcard_stats.last_seen`

3. **Scoring System**
   - **Base XP**: 10 points per correct answer
   - **Accuracy Bonus**: 
     - 80%+ accuracy: +5 XP per correct answer
     - 60-79% accuracy: +2 XP per correct answer
     - <60% accuracy: No bonus
   - **Total Score**: Correct answers + (accuracy bonus / 10)

### Frontend Improvements

1. **Fixed Data Mapping** (`/frontend/expo-fe/app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`)
   - ✅ Maps `total_score` from backend to `totalScore` in UI
   - ✅ Maps `total_flashcards_seen` to `questionsAnswered`
   - ✅ Maps `total_correct` to `correctAnswers`
   - ✅ Maps `current_streak` to `streak` for day streak display

2. **Dynamic Achievement System**
   - **Progress-based**: "Getting Started" (10+), "Half Century" (50+), "Century Club" (100+)
   - **Accuracy-based**: "Good Aim" (70%+), "Sharp Shooter" (80%+), "Perfectionist" (90%+)
   - **Streak-based**: "Consistent" (3+ days), "Week Warrior" (7+ days), "Monthly Master" (30+ days)
   - **Level-based**: "Novice" (Level 2+), "Advanced" (Level 5+), "Expert" (Level 10+)

3. **Improved Type Safety**
   - Added `BackendUserStats` interface for API responses
   - Maintained `UserStats` interface for UI expectations
   - Proper type casting for profile data

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Backend Testing
```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend/api
npm run dev

# Test user stats endpoint (replace with real user token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/user/stats
```

### 2. Frontend Testing
```bash
# Start frontend
cd frontend/expo-fe
npm start

# In ExpoGo:
1. Sign in with a real account (not guest)
2. Navigate to Profile tab
3. Check that statistics display real data:
   - Total Score shows calculated value
   - Questions shows total flashcards seen
   - Day Streak shows consecutive days
   - Achievements based on actual performance
```

### 3. Test Day Streak Logic
```bash
# In your database, you can manually test by:
1. Answer some flashcards today
2. Check user_flashcard_stats.last_seen is updated
3. Profile should show streak of 1
4. Answer flashcards tomorrow - streak should be 2
5. Skip a day - streak should reset to 0
```

## 📈 Example Statistics Display

**Before**: 
- Total Score: 0 (hardcoded)
- Questions: 0 (hardcoded)  
- Day Streak: 0 (incorrect calculation)

**After**:
- Total Score: 85 (45 correct + 4 accuracy bonus)
- Questions: 67 (actual flashcards seen)
- Day Streak: 5 (5 consecutive days of activity)

**Achievements** (based on above stats):
- "Half Century" (50+ questions)
- "Sharp Shooter" (80%+ accuracy)  
- "Advanced" (Level 5+)
- "Consistent" (3+ day streak)

## 🔧 Configuration

**XP Requirements per Level**: 250 XP
- Level 1: 0-249 XP
- Level 2: 250-499 XP
- Level 3: 500-749 XP
- etc.

**Accuracy Bonuses**:
- 80%+ accuracy: 50% XP bonus
- 60-79% accuracy: 20% XP bonus
- <60% accuracy: No bonus

**Streak Rules**:
- Maintains if active today OR yesterday
- Resets if inactive for 2+ consecutive days
- Based on calendar days, not 24-hour periods

## 🐛 Known Issues & Future Enhancements

1. **Timezone Handling**: Currently uses UTC for day calculations
2. **Achievement Persistence**: Achievements are calculated dynamically (not stored)
3. **Streak Recovery**: No grace period for missed days
4. **Language-Specific Stats**: Could track stats per language

## 📱 Mobile Testing Checklist

- [ ] Profile loads without errors
- [ ] Statistics show real calculated values
- [ ] Day streak updates properly
- [ ] Achievements display based on actual performance
- [ ] Level progress bar shows correctly
- [ ] XP calculation matches expectations

This implementation provides a comprehensive user statistics system that calculates real progress based on actual user activity and performance!
